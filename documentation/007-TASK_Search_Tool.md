# Task 007: Search Tool Implementation

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive search tool that leverages Elasticsearch for multi-index search with proper ranking and result processing.

## Implementation Details

### Search Tool Core (`search_tool.py`)
- Create search tool class with LangGraph tool integration
- Implement multi-index Elasticsearch search functionality
- Set up query vectorization with embeddings
- Develop Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm for result ranking
- Create query refinement support

### Query Processing
- Implement query preprocessing
- Create query vectorization using Azure OpenAI embeddings
- Set up query expansion for improved recall
- Develop query classification for search strategy selection

### Result Processing
- Create result post-processing pipeline
- Implement deduplication of search results
- Set up formatting for agent consumption
- Create metadata extraction and standardization
- Implement source attribution

### Performance Optimization
- Set up performance tracing with LangSmith
- Implement search caching for repeated queries
- Create concurrent search execution
- Develop result pagination for large result sets

## Dependencies
- Task 006: Azure OpenAI Integration
- Task 008: Retrieval System
- Elasticsearch Python client

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search tool correctly queries Elasticsearch indices
- [ ] Query vectorization works properly with embeddings
- [ ] RRF algorithm correctly ranks results
- [ ] Query refinement improves search quality
- [ ] Performance tracing provides visibility into search operations
- [ ] Source attribution maintained throughout the search process
