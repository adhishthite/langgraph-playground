# Task 012: Advanced OpenAI Agents Implementation

## Objective
Develop enhanced OpenAI agent implementations with full LangGraph integration and advanced model support.

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Agent Implementation (`openai_agent.py`)
- Update OpenAI agent with full LangGraph integration
- Implement support for all model versions:
  - GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini
  - GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, and GPT-4.1-nano
- Configure model-specific parameter optimization
- Set up structured state management
- Create persistent conversation history

### Advanced Tool Integration
- Enhance tool registration mechanism
- Implement advanced function calling format
- Set up tool execution with state management
- Develop sophisticated tool response processing
- Create tool orchestration with LangGraph nodes

### Enhanced System Prompt
- Create advanced system prompt templates
- Implement dynamic prompt construction
- Set up context-aware prompt modification
- Develop prompt management with versioning
- Create prompt optimization framework

### Performance Optimization
- Implement token usage optimization
- Create parallel tool execution
- Set up response caching
- Develop model selection based on query complexity
- Create detailed performance monitoring
