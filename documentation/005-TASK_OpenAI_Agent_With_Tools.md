# Task 005: OpenAI Agent With Tools

## Objective
Enhance the OpenAI agent with tool-calling capabilities to integrate the previously developed tools.

## Implementation Details

### Tool Integration (`openai_agent_with_tools.py`)
- Extend OpenAI agent with function calling capabilities
- Implement tool registration mechanism
- Create tool calling format adapter for OpenAI
- Set up function calling validation
- Develop tool response processing

### Tool Configuration
- Create tool definition schema
- Implement parameter validation for tools
- Set up tool error handling
- Develop tool metadata management
- Create documentation for available tools

### Advanced Model Support
- Implement support for GPT-4.1 and variants
- Create model-specific tool calling configurations
- Set up optimization for different model strengths
- Develop compatibility layer for different model versions

### Testing and Validation
- Create comprehensive test suite for tool-integrated agent
- Implement scenario-based testing
- Set up performance benchmarking
- Develop error recovery testing
- Create documentation and usage examples

## Dependencies
