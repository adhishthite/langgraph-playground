# Task 016: Comprehensive Observability Implementation

## Objective
Implement comprehensive observability using LangSmith for all agent operations, document retrieval, and performance metrics.

## Implementation Details

### Trace Context Management
- Implement trace context creation for each API request
- Create function spans for key operations
- Set up parent-child span relationships
- Develop metadata enrichment
- Create trace context propagation

### Performance Metrics
- Implement document retrieval metrics capture
- Create token usage measurement for API calls
- Set up latency metrics for all operations
- Develop throughput tracking
- Create resource utilization monitoring

### Error Reporting
- Implement error information preservation with context
- Create error categorization and tracking
- Set up error frequency analysis
- Develop error impact assessment
- Create error resolution tracking

### Quality Assessment
- Implement response quality evaluation
- Create relevance scoring for retrieved documents
- Set up hallucination detection
- Develop source attribution verification
- Create user satisfaction metrics

### Dashboard Integration
- Implement custom LangSmith dashboard setup
- Create visualization configuration
- Set up alerting thresholds
- Develop report generation
- Create trend analysis

## Dependencies
- Task 006: LangGraph Framework Integration (for base tracing)
- Task 008: Enhanced Retrieval System (for document metrics)
- Task 013: SmartSource RAG Agent (for RAG evaluation)
- Task 015: Asynchronous API Implementation (for request tracing)
