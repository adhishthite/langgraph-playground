# Task 017: Human-in-the-Loop Implementation

## Objective
Add human-in-the-loop capabilities to the agent ecosystem for review, approval, and intervention.

## Implementation Details

### Core HITL Functionality
- Implement interrupt mechanism for workflow pausing
- Create command interface for state modification
- Set up breakpoint system for specific nodes
- Develop waiting state for human input
- Create resume functionality with updated state

### Tool Call Review
- Implement review system for tool calls
- Create approval workflow for sensitive operations
- Set up tool call modification interface
- Develop feedback mechanism for LLM correction
- Create logging of human interventions

### State Visualization and Editing
- Implement state visualization for human review
- Create state editing interface
- Set up validation for human edits
- Develop rollback capability for problematic changes
- Create change tracking for audit purposes

### Time Travel and Forking
- Implement time travel for revisiting previous states
- Create state forking for alternative explorations
- Set up comparison between different execution paths
- Develop checkpoint management
- Create documentation for HITL best practices

## Dependencies
- Task 006: LangGraph Framework Integration
- Task 013: SmartSource RAG Agent
- Task 015: Asynchronous API Implementation
