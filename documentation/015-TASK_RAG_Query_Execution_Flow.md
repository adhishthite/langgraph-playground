# Task 015: RAG Query Execution Flow Implementation

## Objective
Establish the complete RAG query execution flow from user query to streamed response.

## Implementation Details

### Query Flow Implementation
- Create end-to-end query execution flow:
  1. User query received via API endpoint
  2. Query vectorized using Azure OpenAI embeddings
  3. Parallel search executed across multiple indices
  4. Results ranked using RRF algorithm
  5. Documents processed and formatted with sources
  6. Response generated by SmartSource agent with citations
  7. Response streamed via SSE to client

### Performance Optimization
- Implement parallel processing where possible
- Create caching strategies for repeated operations
- Set up early termination for irrelevant results
- Develop progressive result delivery
- Create optimized resource utilization

### Error Recovery
- Implement graceful error recovery at each stage
- Create partial result delivery on errors
- Set up fallback strategies for component failures
- Develop comprehensive error categorization
- Create user-friendly error messaging

### Monitoring Integration
- Implement detailed tracing for each step
- Create performance metrics collection
- Set up bottleneck detection
- Develop quality assessment metrics
- Create visualization of query flow in LangSmith
