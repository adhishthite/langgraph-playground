# Task 018: Deployment and Scaling Implementation

## Objective
Create deployment configuration and scaling capabilities for production environments.

## Implementation Details

### Deployment Configuration
- Implement Docker containerization
- Create Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Set up environment variable management
- Develop service definitions
- Create networking configuration

### Persistence Infrastructure
- Implement Redis for state caching
- Create PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Set up connection pooling
- Develop data migration strategy
- Create backup and restore procedures

### Scaling Configuration
- Implement horizontal scaling for API servers
- Create queue worker scaling
- Set up autoscaling based on load
- Develop resource optimization
- Create load balancing configuration

### Resilience Engineering
- Implement circuit breakers for external services
- Create retry policies with backoff
- Set up health checking and self-healing
- Develop fallback strategies
- Create disaster recovery procedures
