# Implementation: Basic OpenAI Agent

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Task 003: Basic OpenAI Agent Implementation. The goal was to create a simple, direct OpenAI agent using LangGraph that provides baseline functionality for interacting with Azure OpenAI models, particularly GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

## Implementation Process

### 1. Agent Structure Creation
- Created `openai_agent.py` module in the `app/agents` directory
- Added `OpenAIAgent` class for agent initialization, configuration, and interaction
- Updated `app/agents/__init__.py` to export the new agent functions
- Created a demo script in `app/agent_demo.py` to showcase the agent's capabilities

### 2. LangGraph Integration
- Implemented the ReAct agent pattern using LangGraph's prebuilt components
- Used `create_react_agent` to create the core agent functionality
- Set up `StateGraph` for managing the agent's state and workflow
- Configured appropriate edges for tool usage and conversation flow
- Added memory-based checkpointing for conversation persistence

### 3. Model Configuration
- Integrated with the existing Azure OpenAI client
- Added support for GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models
- Configured model parameters like temperature
- Set up proper response formats

### 4. System Prompt Configuration
- Created `SystemPromptTemplate` class for managing system prompts
- Added template formatting capabilities
- Implemented default prompts for general assistant behavior
- Added support for custom system prompts

### 5. Conversation History Management
- Implemented thread-based conversation tracking
- Added `MemorySaver` for stateful conversations
- Created unique thread IDs for each conversation
- Set up message history management

### 6. Interaction Interfaces
- Added synchronous API via `invoke` method
- Created asynchronous API via `ainvoke` method
- Implemented streaming support via `stream` and `astream` methods
- Added proper error handling and fallbacks

### 7. Error Handling
- Implemented comprehensive try/except blocks throughout the agent
- Added logging for errors and debugging
- Created graceful fallbacks for API failures
- Added max iterations limit to prevent infinite loops

### 8. Tool Integration
- Set up tool handling using LangGraph's tool support
- Added example tools like a calculator
- Created a demonstration weather and search tool
- Added tool validation and processing

## Key Components

### `OpenAIAgent` Class
The main agent class that handles initialization, configuration, and interaction:

```python
class OpenAIAgent:
    """
    Basic OpenAI agent implementation using LangGraph.
    
    This agent uses the ReAct pattern to reason and act based on available tools.
    It supports both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces.
    """
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        model_name: str = "gpt-4o",
        temperature: float = 0.7,
        system_prompt: Optional[str] = None,
        tools: Optional[List[BaseTool]] = None,
        max_iterations: int = 10,
    ):
        # Implementation...
```

### LangGraph Agent Construction
The core agent graph construction using LangGraph:

```python
def _build_agent_graph(self) -> None:
    """Build the ReAct agent graph using LangGraph."""
    # Create the ReAct agent
    self.agent_runnable = create_react_agent(
        self.llm,
        self.tools,
        system_prompt=self.system_prompt,
    )
    
    # Define agent state
    class AgentState(TypedDict):
        messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], operator.add]
        tools: List[BaseTool]
    
    # Create the graph
    builder = StateGraph(AgentState)
    
    # Add agent node
    builder.add_node("agent", self.agent_runnable)
    
    # Define edges
    builder.set_entry_point("agent")
    builder.add_conditional_edges(
        "agent",
        lambda state: "tool" if state.get("tool_calls") else END,
        {
            "tool": "agent",
            END: END,
        },
    )
    
    # Compile the graph
    self.graph = builder.compile()
```

### Synchronous and Asynchronous Interfaces
Support for both blocking and non-blocking interaction:

```python
def invoke(self, message: str) -> str:
    """
    Invoke the agent synchronously with a user message.
    
    Args:
        message: The user message
        
    Returns:
        The agent's response
    """
    # Implementation...

async def ainvoke(self, message: str) -> str:
    """
    Invoke the agent asynchronously with a user message.
    
    Args:
        message: The user message
        
    Returns:
        The agent's response
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### Streaming Support
Streaming capabilities for real-time responses:

```python
def stream(self, message: str):
    """
    Stream the agent's response to a user message.
    
    Args:
        message: The user message
        
    Yields:
        Chunks of the agent's response
    """
    # Implementation...

async def astream(self, message: str):
    """
    Stream the agent's response asynchronously to a user message.
    
    Args:
        message: The user message
        
    Yields:
        Chunks of the agent's response
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### Helper Functions
Utility functions for creating agents with default configurations:

```python
def create_default_agent(
    model_name: str = "gpt-4o", 
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    system_prompt: Optional[str] = None
) -> OpenAIAgent:
    """
    Create an OpenAI agent with default tools.
    
    Args:
        model_name: The model to use (gpt-4o or gpt-4o-mini)
        temperature: The temperature for generation
        system_prompt: Custom system prompt
        
    Returns:
        OpenAI agent instance
    """
    # Implementation...
```

## Demo Application

A demo script (`app/agent_demo.py`) was created to showcase the agent's capabilities:

1. **Synchronous Demo**: Demonstrates direct question answering and calculations
2. **Asynchronous Demo**: Shows how to use streaming with weather and search tools
3. **Custom Agent Creation**: Illustrates creating agents with custom tools and prompts

- ✅ Basic OpenAI agent successfully initializes and connects to Azure
- ✅ Agent supports different model types (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- ✅ System prompts are correctly configured and applied
- ✅ Simple conversation history is maintained
- ✅ Basic error handling works correctly
