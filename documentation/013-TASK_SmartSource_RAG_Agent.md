# Task 013: SmartSource RAG Agent Implementation

## Objective
Develop the SmartSource RAG Agent that leverages all previously built components for advanced retrieval-augmented generation.

## Implementation Details

### Core Agent Implementation (`smartsource_agent.py`)
- Create SmartSource RAG agent with LangGraph
- Implement conversation history management
- Define agent nodes for query processing, retrieval, and response generation
- Configure tool usage for retrieval operations
- Set up agent workflow with state management

### RAG Functionality
- Implement multi-index search integration
- Create document formatting with source attribution
- Develop vector and hybrid search capabilities
- Implement Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for result ranking
- Set up document context integration with LLM prompts

### Conversation Management
- Design state schema for conversation history
- Implement conversation truncation for context limits
- Create message summarization for long conversations
- Set up message attribution and tracking
- Develop semantic memory for important information

### Advanced Features
- Implement query refinement
- Create follow-up question generation
- Set up source verification
- Develop confidence scoring
- Create explanation generation for search results

## Dependencies
- Task 008: Enhanced Retrieval System
- Task 009: Document Processing
- Task 010: Advanced Search Tool
- Task 012: Advanced OpenAI Agents
