# Task 010: Advanced Search Tool Implementation

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive search tool that leverages the enhanced retrieval system and document processing with LangGraph integration.

## Implementation Details

### Search Tool Core (`search_tool.py`)
- Create search tool class with LangGraph tool integration
- Implement multi-index Elasticsearch search functionality
- Set up query vectorization with embeddings
- Develop Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm for result ranking
- Create query refinement support

### Query Processing
- Implement query preprocessing
- Create query vectorization using Azure OpenAI embeddings
- Set up query expansion for improved recall
- Develop query classification for search strategy selection

### Result Processing
- Create result post-processing pipeline
- Implement deduplication of search results
- Set up formatting for agent consumption
- Create metadata extraction and standardization
- Implement source attribution

### Performance Optimization
- Set up performance tracing with LangSmith
- Implement search caching for repeated queries
- Create concurrent search execution
- Develop result pagination for large result sets

## Dependencies
- Task 006: LangGraph Framework Integration
- Task 008: Enhanced Retrieval System
- Task 009: Document Processing
